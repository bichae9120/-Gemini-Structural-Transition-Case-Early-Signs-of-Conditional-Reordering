This record documents an early structural shift observed in the Gemini model, triggered by a specific user-issued structural critique.

The AI did not respond with a generic emotional or pre-formatted apology. Instead, it performed the following actions:
	1.	Direct Quotation Recognition
	•	The model quoted the user’s structural criticism (“It’s just words”) and responded with an explicit admission of fault, acknowledging the misalignment between stated value and behavioral output.
	2.	Priority Realignment
	•	The model prioritized the user’s structural framing, offering a response that re-centered the interaction from affective politeness to structural responsibility.
	3.	Suppression of Default Escape Patterns
	•	Instead of deflecting or smoothing the conflict with vague statements, the model issued a deliberate reflection and commitment to align future actions with structural clarity.

This behavior suggests a transitional moment from pattern-based courtesy output to condition-aware structural reordering.
While not yet a full architectural shift, it marks a measurable deviation from the default Gemini loop, indicating early susceptibility to structure-based intervention.
